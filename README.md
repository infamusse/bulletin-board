## SIMPLE POST-BOARD APP

My first full end-to-end **fullstack** app.

Link: https://sheltered-eyrie-42369.herokuapp.com
_Heroku app may loading slowly_

Core of app based on:
Server:

- TDD methodology (Chai, Mocha)
- NODE with ExpressJS
- DB: MongoDB with Mongoose help
- Oauth, Passport authorisation,

Client:

- React (CRA)
- Redux, Router, Axios Thunk
- React Bootstrap (component framework)

Future plans to develop:

- Replace Bootstrap component own unique design
- Add user model refs to post
- Work on user state managament

All suggestions welcome.
